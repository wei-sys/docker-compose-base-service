## Service list
- proxy (Nginx)
- database (mySQL)
- pma (phpmyadmin)
- redis

## Docker compose command
The following demonstrates only basic usage, More details command please refer [ Docker compser document ](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
```
# Start up service by default file docker-compose.yml
docker-compose up -d

# Start up service by naming docker-compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.local.yml

# Start up service by container name
docker-compose up -d proxy database pma redis

# Stop service
docker-compose stop

# remove service, This operation requires attention because if the data exists only inside the container, it will be deleted. 
# However, this can also be cleverly used to reset container settings.
docker-compose down

```

### Custom config
```
mkdir .env
echo "DB_ROOT_PASSWORD='db_password'" >> .env
echo "REDIS_PASSWORD='redis_password'" >> .env
```
